# SQL Tutorial

This is an English text-version of lessons [published on Youtube (in Russian)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwVBSkoL97Q3q7zHVJLojlu1xs7_xdJ0c), which will introduce you to the world of PostgreSQL and SQL Syntax, in the context of [Telegram bots](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api).

### This is only the half of all lessons and this part does not cover the lessons where we connect SQLAlchemy with our bots.

So if you liked this part and want to integrate **SQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **Alembic** and **SQLAlchemy** into your bots, you can purchase a full bot-development course on [my website](https://botfather.dev/) and you'll get an access to the second part of the tutorial (text and videos). (That part is still in development and I'll remove this message when it is available).
